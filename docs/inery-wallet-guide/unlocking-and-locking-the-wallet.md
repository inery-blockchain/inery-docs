# Unlocking and Locking the Wallet

<br/>

To unlock a wallet, execute the following command:

<br/>

```shell
cline wallet unlock -n YOUR_WALLET_NAME
```

<br/>

This command will prompt you to input your password if your wallet was previously locked.
If instead you wish to lock your wallet, you may do so by calling the `lock` command:

<br/>

```shell
cline wallet lock -n YOUR_WALLET_NAME
```
