# Importing a Key to a Wallet

<br/>

To import your key into the Inery wallet on your node you need to execute the following command:

<br/>

```shell
cline wallet import -n YOUR_WALLET_NAME â€“private-key
```

<br/>

This will prompt you to input the corresponding private key of your public-private key pair. By entering it, your public key will be added to your wallet. The list of keys in your wallet can be checked by executing the following command:

<br/>

```shell
cline wallet keys -n YOUR_WALLET_NAME
```
